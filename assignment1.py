# 1. Write a python program that is able to calculate the BMI of a person whose weight is 78kgs and height is 1.75 meters. BMI = (weight) / (height squared)
weight = 78
height = 1.75
BMI = (weight) / (height**2)
print("The BMI of a person is: ", BMI)
print(type(BMI))

# 2. Find the Area and perimeter of a rectangle whose length is 48cm and width is 25cm
length = 48
width = 25
Area = (length * width)
print("The area of the rectangle is: ", Area)
print(type(Area))

length = 48
width = 25
Perimeter = (length + width)*2
print("The perimeter of the rectangle is: ", Perimeter)
print(type(Perimeter))
